For maps:
 Top level has two layers, lakes and land
 Second layer contains layers and sublayers

For Asset-drive images
 Create the asset you wish to include
 If you want it selectable, create a work path in photoshop by:
   use magic wand to outline the shape
   inverse selection
   go to layers panel and switch to paths panel
   right click hamburger menu and click "make workpath"
   copy that workpath to illustrator and put it behind the image layer.
   So, on top will be the texture layer with class "passthrough" 
   On bottom will be the border layer with class "selectable"
   The borders group layer (parent element) must be "No Fill"
   You'll need to manually change .cls{fill:#fff} to ensure it is #fff instead of "none"
