**Generosity** is how inclined the parent is to give treats or spend money simply out of kindness.
When the child asks for something, roll **1d10 and add the parent’s Generosity**. If that total meets or exceeds a GM‑assigned *Need Score* for the item, the parent agrees (a higher margin means extra generosity).

**Wealth** reflects how much the family can realistically afford on the spot.
Roll **1d10 and add the parent’s Wealth** against a *Cost Score* the GM assigns to the item’s price. If the roll reaches or beats the Cost Score, the family can pay for it; otherwise they refuse for financial reasons.

**Permissiveness** shows how comfortable the parent is allowing risky, late‑night, or rule‑bending activities.
Roll **1d10 plus Permissiveness** and compare it to a *Risk Score* set by the GM. If the total equals or exceeds that score, the parent grants permission; if not, they say no.
